/* 
THIRD GREATEST
using the javascript language, have the function thirdGreates(strArr) take the array of strings in strArr and return the third largest word within in.

So for example:
if strArr is ["hello", "world", "before", "all"] your output should b world because "before" is 6 letters long, and "hello" and "world" are both 5, but the output should be world because it appeared as the last 5 letters word in the array.

If strArr was ["hello", "world", "after", "all"] the output should be after because the first three words are all 5 letters long, so return the last one. The array will have at least three strings and each string will only contain letters.

const thirdGreatest = (strArr) => {
  /* WAY 1
    arr.sort((a,b) => b.length - a.length)
    return arr[2]
